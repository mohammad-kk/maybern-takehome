Maybern - Engineering Challenge
For your take-home assessment, you’ll be building a waterfall engine. A waterfall is a
method by which the profits from investments are distributed among the vario
stakeholders involved. This distribution structure specifies the order and rules for h
returns are shared between limited partners (LPs), who are typically the investors
providing the capital, and the general partners (GPs), who manage the private equity
fund.
For this exercise, you will build a 4-tier waterfall with an 8% hurdle, 100% catch-up, and
80/20 split for the final tie

Key Concepts
Return of Capital
The first priority in most waterfall structures is to return the original investment to t
LPs. Before any profits are distributed, the initial capital contributions are typically pa
back. This means for every dollar invested by LP, the LP is entitled to a dollar back, so if
an LP makes a $1000 contribution the GP needs to return $1000 before capital can fl
to the next tier.
Preferred Return (Hurdle Rate)
After the return of capital, the next step is usually the preferred return, which is a
specified rate of return that the LPs are entitled to receive before the GPs c
participate in further profit sharing. For this exercise, we’ll use a rate of 8%, whi
means the investment must achieve a return of 8% before the GPs can receive their
share of the profit
The formula for calculating preferred return is as follows,

C * (1 + R)
(d/365)

C = cash flow
d = the number of days
R = pref rate

For example, if an investor contributed $1000 on 01/01/2019 the amount of pref they
would be owed on 01/01/2020 assuming an 8% IRR hurdle rate would be.

$1000 * (1 + . 08)

(365/365) = $1080

This means they would need to return $1000 of ROC and $80 of preferred return to
progress to the catch-up tier.
Catch-Up Tier
This stage allows the GPs to "catch up" with the LPs in terms of total profits. Once t
LPs have received their preferred return, the GPs may receive a large percentage of the
subsequent distributions until they have received a specified proportion of the tot
profits, usually making the total distributions proportional to the agreed-upon split (e.g
80% LPs, 20% GPs).
Our waterfall will be configured with a 100% catch-up and a final split of 80/20 wit
going to the LP and 20% going to the GP.
The formula for calculating the total amount in the catch-up tier is as follows.

CU = ci% * PR/(cu% − ci%)
CU = 20%/(100% − 20%) * PR

CU = 25% PR

CU = Catch up amount
cu% =catch-up percentage rate
ci% =carried interest percentage rate
PR = preferred return

Final Split
This is the profit share that the GPs receive beyond the preferred return and catch-
tranches. Carried interest is typically set at a percentage of the profits (commonly 20
and is meant to incentivize the GPs to maximize the returns from their investments.

Tables
Commitment
A Commitment represents an ownership stake in the investment, in the example below
both Nate and Cooper each have an investment for 1M and 2M respectively in fund #1.
For this exercise, you can ignore the fund concept and focus on running waterfalls at the
commitment level.

entity_name id fund_id commitment_amount
Nate Cooper 1 1 $1,000,000
Cooper Smith 2 1 $2,000,000

Transactions
During the life of an investment, the LP will contribute money to the investment and
periodically receive distributions depending on the investment's performance. The
amount they can call is limited to the investor commitment.

Note: Contributions are stored as negatives and distributions are stored as positives.

In the example above we assume a single contribution and a single distribution, in
reality a fund can have hundreds of transactions for a single investor. In the event of
having multiple distributions, the waterfall is still run once per investor. The total amount
flowing through the waterfall is the total sum of distribution for the investo

Technology
Feel free to develop in any programming language of your choice and leverage
open-source libraries or tools that you would use in a production environment. We
recommend using a language you have experience in so that you can showcase your
best coding abilities.

Application
Your application should take as input two files commitments.csv, and
transactions.csv, and produce an output that details how much capital was allocated to
each tier of the waterfall per investor.
